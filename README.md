# Stock-Market-Prediction-
My intern Project Project - Stock Market Prediction Time series data represents a sequence of data points that are indexed in chronological order. Due to its prevalence, efficiently handling time series data is essential for data analysts and data scientists.

In this notebook, we will explore and analyze data from the stock market, focusing on technology stocks like Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. We will learn how to use yfinance to fetch stock information and visualize different aspects using Seaborn and Matplotlib. Our analysis will include evaluating the risk of a stock based on its historical performance, and we will attempt to predict future stock prices using the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) method.

Throughout the notebook, we will address the following questions:

1.) How has the stock's price evolved over time?

2.) What is the average daily return of the stock?

3.) How does the moving average of the various stocks fluctuate?

4.) What is the correlation between different stocks?

5.) What is the level of risk associated with investing in a particular stock?

6.) Can we make predictions about future stock behavior, specifically the closing price of APPLE Inc, using LSTM?
